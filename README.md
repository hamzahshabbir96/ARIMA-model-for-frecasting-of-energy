## FAQ

#### 1. What this project is about?

Idea of this project is to implement time series model to forecast different energy parameter of the world for example what percent of ppulation will be able to access electricity in future. Time series model includes famous Autoregressive integrated moving average model.
#### 2. Is there any dashboard or visualization to get glimpse of data? 

Yes this app has been deployed for visualization. It can be followed from here : [Go to dashboard website](https://dashhamzah.herokuapp.com/)

#### 3. Does visualization part include forecasted database?

No Visualization only includes data from World databank(original data). Since accuracy of ARIMA model depends on lot of factors such as choosing AR and MA parameter. It has to be manually computed and to avoid wrong interpretations of forecasted data, it was not visually presented.
